# Welcome to the Wavefront Go SDK

Wavefront by VMware Go SDK lets you send raw data from your Go application to Wavefront using a `Sender` interface.
The data is then stored as metrics, histograms, and trace data. This SDK is also called the Wavefront Sender SDK for Go. 

Although this library is mostly used by the other Wavefront Go SDKs to send data to Wavefront, 
you can also use this SDK directly. For example, you can send data directly from a data store or CSV file to Wavefront.

For detailed documentation of SDK types and functions, see [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/wavefronthq/wavefront-sdk-go/senders)
